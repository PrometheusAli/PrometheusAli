### ✅ Next Enhancement Ideas for This Profile
- Add links to sample CAD models (exported neutral formats: STEP/DXF).
- Include a “Design Process” section (Concept → Sketch → Parametric Model → Drawing).
- Publish a small comparison of material choices used in coursework (density vs application).
- Add English proficiency level once standardized test is completed.
